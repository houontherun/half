
**************** QMAPEXP - Quake Map Exporter for 3DS MAX *************

(c) Copyright Phil Camp 1996

You are granted a licence to use QMAPEXP and its components to create 
MAP files for non-profit use with the registered version of Quake. 

QMAPEXP is provided 'as is', no guarantee or warranty is given or implied.

Please Note: You *MUST* have the full retail version of Quake to run levels
generated by QMAPEXP. The shareware version will not work correctly.

----- Known Problems ------

1) Cones with a radius2 of zero dont work.
To workaround - make radius2 a small value.

2) Any curved objects with too many faces cause QBSP
to give 'duplicate plane errors'. This appears to
be a Quake restriction.

3) The 'angle' spinner in the door parameters rollout is a bit
'sticky'. For some reason you can drag the spinner to create the 
negative values, but you cant just click the down button.

------ Release Notes -----
***Version 1.04 (Build 001) 03-Nov-96

1) Fixed bug with attached entities. Exporter now correctly
exports attached entity helper objects that are not of type
'func_door'.

2) Exporter now warns if any brushes have too few Quake planes.

3) Demo scene 2 now has raising platform to demonstrate linked
entities.

***Version 1.03 (Build 001) 28-Oct-96

1) The exporter now uses the UV parameters of a diffuse map of type
'bitmap' to control the Quake texture parameters on each brush.

Help file updated.

***Version 1.02 (Build 001) 18-Oct-96

New features in Quake entity helper:

1) The helper now has its own 'Quake' category in the helpers pane.

2) A selection of 'preset' entity buttons are now included for the
most commonly used entities.

3) All entities now have a 'Map Parameters' rollup which allows any
entity settings to be configured.

4) QEntHlp now knows about the specific parameters for a Quake door
and shows them in a 'Door Params' rollout for entities of class
'func_door'.

Exporter now allows attached Quake entities indicated by MAX link
heirarchy.

Demo scene file has been re-built using MAX's snap to ensure no leaks
(see not below about QBSP256). It also now contains an example door.
Both old and new demo scenes are provided.

Help file updated.

NB. QBSP256

During the building of the new scene file I have found that the
utility QBSP256 seems to generate false leak reports. Simply putting
a player start entity in a totally sealed level causes QBSP256 to
write a 'pts' file and report leaks. Running the MAP file through the
'normal' Id QBSP (if possible due to face limits) does not report any leaks.


***Version 1.01 (Build 001) 11-Oct-96***

New plugin 'QEntHelp' implements a Quake Entity helper
object. 

Exporter now handles the new Entity helpers. 

Export dialog fields now active. Data entered is written
into the Quake MAP file header.

Plug-in name reporting fixed for MAX's plug-in summary operation.

Demo scene now has some entities.

***Version 1.00 (Build 002) 09-Oct-96***

Now exports omnilights as standard quake lights.
Use attenuation outer limit as Quake brightness.

Demo scene expanded to show many primitives, lights,
extruded splines and simple doorway.

***Version 1.00 (Build 001) 07-Oct-96***

Initial (very) alpha version.
