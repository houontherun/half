   Purpose: Defines an interface for circular buffers. Data can be written to
			and read from these buffers as though from a file. When it is 
			write-overflowed (you write more data in than the buffer can hold),
			the read pointer is advanced to allow the new data to be written.
			This means old data will be discarded if you write too much data
			into the buffer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * $Log:         MikeD:	Moved all the functions into a class.
						Changed it so when the buffer overflows, the old data
						is discarded rather than the new.
